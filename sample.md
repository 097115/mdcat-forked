# A first level header

Some content in between, with some inline formatting as in **bold text** or
*italic text*, or even `inline code`.

## A second level header

Some content
with soft breaks.

Another paragraph has an auto-link (see <https://www.example.com>) inside.

We can also do block quotes:

> Hello world, also with *emphasis*, and **strong** text, and some `inline
> code`.

### A third level header

Some content\
with hard\
breaks and an \
inline [link](http://example.com) within.

> Also, a block quote with paragraphs?
>
> We have a new paragraph here.
>
> â€”Some cool folks

Or, code blocks:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello world");
}
```

## Back to second level

Text with [reference][42] links, followed by a list

* Hello
* World
    * How are you?
    * Fine?
    * Even with paragraphs?
* So long

More text is beyond a ruler
